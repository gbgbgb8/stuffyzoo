1. Little Emma decides to take her stuffed elephant, Fluffy, to the Stuffy Zoo.
2. She opens the Stuffy Zoo app on her parent's tablet and clicks "Zoo Visitor".
3. Emma enters "Fluffy" as the visitor name.
4. She chooses the $100 Elephant Enthusiast ticket (because Fluffy is an elephant, of course!).

6. Emma pretends to hand the tablet to Fluffy, who now has a ticket to enter the zoo.

### Scenario 2: Zoo Employee - Zookeeper Zoe

1. Emma's older sister, Zoe, decides to play the role of the zookeeper.
2. Zoe opens the Stuffy Zoo app on her smartphone and selects "Zoo Employee".
3. She enters the secret PIN (1234) to access the employee area.
4. The QR code scanner activates on Zoe's phone.
5. Zoe pretends to greet Fluffy at the zoo entrance and asks to see the ticket.
6. Emma holds up the tablet with Fluffy's QR code ticket.
7. Zoe scans the QR code with her phone.
8. The app makes an elephant trumpet sound and displays Fluffy's information.
